#In short, based on everything we have seen, at least from a financial standpoint (as of right now) our local rep may soon just loose her position in the house and not make it to the Senate.
#She simply is not getting the support she will need to really compete in the race. She has been the rep for 10 years at this point, so with her not running for congress anymore, what does that mean for 
#the future of central Missouri.

#At minimum we can report just on the numbers and at maximum, with interviews with some of the other contestants running for her spot in our district, we can see (through the political speech) what may be in store
#for central Missouri. Alternatively, we could ask her what she thinks her chances are for winning the election to the Senate spot (and no offense to her, but she is not well liked by a lot of people here in Como, and I think she knows that)

#Possible headline: Vicky Hartzler set to (unofficially) retire from congress. 

#kinda true, kinda just a burn ^

#I recognize I have more code than those my peers may have had in my group, but I just noticed some things much later than I should have.
